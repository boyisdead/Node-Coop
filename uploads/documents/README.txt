8 robots have gone on a rampage and are wreaking havoc on the city and 
throughout the world! The robots are Dr. Wily’s creations! However, 
Dr. Wily claimed that the robots are not under his control and has 
vowed to help fix the problem along with Dr. Light...
But just as they both start to work on their investigation of the 
mysterious force that took control of Wily’s robots, a shadowy figure 
breaks into the lab and kidnaps Dr. Wily!
Dr. Wily: “Help!!!”
Dr. Light: “Mega Man! Go after Wily’s kidnapper! It might be the key to 
this mystery!
Mega Man: “Right! I’m on it!”
Mega Man runs off into action once again with his trusty companion Rush.
Meanwhile, standing on top of a damaged building, Proto Man also looks on as 
the city goes up in flames. 
He then disappears in the shadows, hoping to find out some answers himself...
